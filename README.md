## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm Matheus Infingardi, a passionate software development student at 42 School. I’ve been working on coding projects since 2018 and I'm continuously learning new technologies and tools.

On this GitHub, I share my journey through the 42 curriculum, personal projects, and explorations into different programming languages and frameworks. I believe in the power of innovation and technology to solve problems and improve productivity.

Feel free to check out my projects and let's keep coding together! 🚀
